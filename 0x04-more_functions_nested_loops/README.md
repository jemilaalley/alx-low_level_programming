2 - write a function that multiplies two integers.

3 - write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4 - write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5 - write a funtion that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6 - write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7 - write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8 - write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. 

9 - Fizz-Buzz - write a program that prints the number from 1 - 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three, print fizz the number, and for multiples of five, print buzz.. For numbers which are multiples of both, print FizzBuzz..

10 - write a funtion that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
